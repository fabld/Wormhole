Title: Wormhole 
Desc: Ajax data save in jQuery and PHP
Author: Ryan Carter (fabld on github.com)

This little project is simplistic and not super complicated for a reason. When you need a simple, quick and dirty way to save data without leaving the page, this is a way to do it. It is not the best way for sure. It has been incredibly useful for me, so I wanted to share.

index.php is the main page, it is all just jQuery, so you could use it in ASP.NET, html, php, or a number of other languages.

it calls ajax.php and sends it some data, which is in HTTP GET format, so you grab that and slam dunk it into the database and pass back results or a status message to index via echos (in PHP).


Have fun!
